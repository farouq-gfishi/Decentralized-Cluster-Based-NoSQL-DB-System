# Decentralized Cluster-Based NoSQL Database System

This project implements a decentralized cluster-based NoSQL database system using Java. The system enables users to interact with nodes within the cluster, execute database operations, and ensures data consistency and load balance without relying on a central manager node.

## Key Features

### Cluster Interaction:
- Seamlessly interacts with nodes within the cluster for distributed data management.
- Facilitates database operations across multiple nodes for enhanced scalability.

### Data Consistency and Load Balance:
- Ensures data consistency and load balance without the need for a central manager node.
- Distributes workload evenly across nodes for optimal performance.

### Multithreading Optimization:
- Utilizes multithreading techniques for efficient resource utilization and faster processing.
- Enhances system performance through concurrent execution of tasks.

### Security Measures:
- Implements strong security measures to protect data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.
- Enforces authentication and authorization mechanisms for user roles and permissions.

### Hash Indexing for Speed:
- Implements hash indexing algorithms for quick data retrieval and efficient query processing.
- Optimizes data access speed for improved system responsiveness.

### Communication Protocol:
- Utilizes HTTP(S) protocol for seamless communication between nodes.
- Ensures encrypted data transmission for enhanced security and privacy.

### DevOps Integration:
- Implements CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment.
- Utilizes Docker for containerized deployment, ensuring consistency across different environments.

### Comprehensive Testing Suite:
- Includes a comprehensive suite of tests for validating system functionality and performance.
- Adopts test-driven development practices for reliable and robust code implementation.
